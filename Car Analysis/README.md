# Car Analysis




In this example, we will first examine the dataset created with the characteristics of "year", "price", "transmission", "milage", "tax", "mpg" and "engineSize" of used cars in the UK, and we will make the dataset more consistent by making some changes to it. 

We will then create a regression model that we will use for prediction and train our model with 70% of our dataset using features other than "price". 

Finally, we will try to estimate the "price" values of the cars using the model we trained and use error metrics for measuring the performance of the model.
