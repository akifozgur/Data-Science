# Olympics Analysis

* In this notebook, we will analyze the Olympics which organize from 1896 to 2016.

* First of all, we will clean up data in our data set that does not make sense to us. On the other hand, we will remove some data from our data set, while filling in the missing data by averaging the other non-missing data for some data. 

* Then we will analyze univariate, bivariate, and multivariate data. We will use the Pivot Table when performing multivariate data analysis. 

* Then we will make anomaly detection. We will do this anomaly detection for the properties "Age", Weight" and "Height". After all, we will analyze our data over time.
